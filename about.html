  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a QA Engineer turned full-stack and embedded systems enthusiast, blending hands-on software testing experience 
    with real-world development across mobile, backend, and hardware-integrated systems. My recent work includes building 
    a BLE-connected smart cooling system for prosthetics, API automation tools, and modernizing app interfaces using React Native and TypeScript.
  </p>
  <p>
    I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Colorado Boulder and have transitioned toward 
    SDET and DevOps roles with a strong focus on backend development, automation, and scalable cloud systems. I learn fast, ship clean, 
    and enjoy building practical solutions that make a measurable impact.
